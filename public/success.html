      <p class="lead">The class of 2020 has undeniably had a raw deal.
      The pandemic has destroyed your University experience and you have been unable to enjoy
      some of the best times of your adult life.</p>

      <p>So what? Many might say. People are dying. There are more important things right now.
      That’s true, and that’s why it’s been right to close events. shut Universities and stay at home.
      It’s better to lose a Birthday party than someone lose all their Birthdays.</p>
      
      <p>
        But, we don’t believe you need to miss out entirely. And that is why we have launched this site.
        To share with you our ideas about what we could do in the future once it is safe to do so.
        We ask you one simple question:
        
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="mb-0">If we build it, will you come?</h3>

            <h2>Our idea</h2>
            <p>5 days of events celebrating the end of University
            and your quarantine freedom. To include many
            of your favourites:</p>

            <ul class="list-unstyled">
              <li>CRISIS</li>
              <li>Grad Ball</li>
              <li>Ocean</li>
              <li>Sports Ball</li>
              <li>Shapes</li>
              <li>Caramello</li>
              <li>Day Parties</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One week of massive celebrations in Nottingham</p>
          </div>
          <div class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">
          <h2>Who?</h2>

          <p>
            Priority for final year students leaving Nottingham.
            But other year groups welcome after.
          </p>
          </div>
          <div class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">
          <h2>When?</h2>
          <p>Clearly this is out of our hands for the most part and it goes
          without saying we will do nothing whilst it’s not safe.</p>

          <h4>August and early September</h4>
          <p>If the virus kicks us further into the Summer the events themselves are still feasible. However, there comes more accommodation issues.
          This would create a couple of options for accommodation…</p>

          <h4>Accomodation</h4>
          <p>Open halls of residence at a reduced rate. Yes, you may end up back in your old hall for a week!
          Commercial hotels in Nottingham block booked by us to get the best rates and keep friendship groups together (think ski trip)</p>


          <h4>October, November & beyond...</h4>
          <p>In the event that social distancing still prevents us opening up events until October/November then the package of events would likely
          change to a weekend format of events on a Friday to a Sunday basis. We would also need to utilise hotel accommodation in the city.
          This is logistically more challenging so we would also consider doing a one off large reunion event in London if that was not looking feasible.</p>
